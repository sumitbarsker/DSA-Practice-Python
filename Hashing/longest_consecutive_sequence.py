# Problem: Longest Consecutive Sequence
# Platform: LeetCode
# Difficulty: Medium

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        numbers = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in numbers:
            if num - 1 not in numbers:
                length = 1

                while num + length in numbers:
                    length += 1

                longest = max(longest, length)

        return longest
