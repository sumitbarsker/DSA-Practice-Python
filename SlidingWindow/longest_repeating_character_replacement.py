# Problem: Longest Repeating Character Replacement
# Platform: LeetCode
# Difficulty: Medium

class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s, k):
        count = {}
        left = 0
        max_frequency = 0
        longest = 0

        for right in range(len(s)):
            char = s[right]
            count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1

            max_frequency = max(max_frequency, count[char])

            window_length = right - left + 1

            if window_length - max_frequency > k:
                count[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1

            longest = max(longest, right - left + 1)

        return longest
